# Youtube Video Saving app

An App to save useful YouTube videos and comeback to them later. Using LocalStorage to store the videos (will move to MongoDB at a later date). To generate thumbnails, I'm using [ytimg](`https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VIDEO_ID/`) service, that takes in YouTube video ID and returns an image in various sizes.
