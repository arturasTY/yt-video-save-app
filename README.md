# Youtube Video Saver app

Built with [![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,html,css,wasm)](https://skillicons.dev)

An App to save useful YouTube videos and comeback to them later. Using LocalStorage to store the videos (will move to MongoDB at a later date). To generate thumbnails, I'm using [ytimg](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VIDEO_ID/) service, that takes in YouTube video id and returns an image in various sizes. Thanks to [HappyHues](https://www.happyhues.co/) for the colour scheme inspiration.
